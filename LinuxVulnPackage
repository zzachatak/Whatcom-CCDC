Category 1: Legacy / Insecure Network Services (HIGH RISK)

These are immediate red flags during audits and pentests.

Package	Why It’s Dangerous	Replace With
telnet, telnet-server	Plaintext credentials	openssh-server
ftp, vsftpd, proftpd	Plaintext auth / file access	SFTP
rsh, rlogin, rexec	Trust-based auth (no passwords)	SSH
tftp	No auth, trivial abuse	SCP / SFTP
xinetd	Exposes legacy services	systemd-native services

Web Services You Don’t Explicitly Need

Category 2: If the system is not a web server, these are major red flags.

Package	Risk
apache2, httpd	Exposed HTTP attack surface
nginx	Same as above
php, php-fpm	RCE, file upload abuse
tomcat, jetty	Java RCE history
nodejs, npm	Supply-chain risk
lighttpd	Often forgotten
